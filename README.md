# Adversarial - Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Adv-MARL)

The aim is test and implement MARL algorithms in the presence adversarial agents.

- Currently modeled a Grid_World of multi agent systems using tools from Gym.

## Multi-Agent Gridworld
We consider a grid-world of dimension (6 x 6). We note that the tuples (0, 0) and (5, 5) correspond to the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid, respectively.
